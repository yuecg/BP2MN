## BP2MN

We propose a parallel dense prediction backbone network that combines standard
ViT with multi-layer, multi-scale CNN features to address the issues of insufffcient internal patch feature interaction and single-scale representation in ViT. It also
directly loads various open-source pretrained ViT weights.


We design the 3M and the LGTM. The former captures multi-receptive ffeld spatial
features, while the latter performs local and global feature temporal fusion at each
layer to obtain richer semantic information, thus improving the handling of dense
prediction tasks.
